# Image and Document Metadata Extractor :-

MetaSniff is a lightweight Python tool designed for **ethical metadata extraction** from common image and document formats.  
It helps identify hidden or embedded information in files—useful for cybersecurity, audits, digital forensics, or even fun fact-checking!

##  What It Does ?

- Extracts **EXIF metadata** from `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` images
- Pulls **document properties** from `.pdf` files (author, title, creation date, etc.)
- Retrieves **Word doc info** from `.docx` (title, author, revision history, etc.)

##  Supported File Types :-

| Type     | Extensions         | Metadata Extracted |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Image    | .jpg, .jpeg, .png  | EXIF info (camera, GPS, etc.) |
| PDF      | .pdf               | Document properties |
| Word     | .docx              | Core file metadata  |
